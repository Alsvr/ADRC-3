abstract="{The first edition became a widely used text in universities worldwide
    as well as the standard reference for professionals. The second edition
    featured new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and
    randomized algorithms, and linear programming. The third edition has been
    revised and updated throughout. It includes two completely new chapters, on
    van Emde Boas trees and multithreaded algorithms, and substantial additions
    to the chapter on recurrences (now called ``Divide-and-Conquer"). It
    features improved treatment of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms and
    a new notion of edge-based flow in the material on flow networks. Many new
    exercises and problems have been added for this edition.
